<p>Triangle-area friends! If you're free this Thursday (September 24th), come on out to&nbsp;<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?client=safari&amp;q=324+Blackwell+Street,+Suite+410+Durham,+North+Carolina+27701&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=324+Blackwell+St,+Durham,+NC+27701&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=9-ezSrH0FMuZ8Abm8pWTDw&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A">Bronto's offices</a> for&nbsp;<a href="http://refreshthetriangle.org/">Refresh the Triangle</a>. I'm going to be giving a talk on&nbsp;<em>The Future of Data</em> &ndash; or, less impressively, the recent movements in the database landscape.  This'll be an interesting presentation, since the Refresh audience is generally a mix between designers and developers. I imagine this particular meeting will be developer-heavy, but I'm working to make the talk as designer- and front-end-dev-friendly as possible. I'll be focusing on two points: offline storage in HTML5 (applicable to everyone), and the emergence of non-relational databases (like document-oriented databases). Both topics should&nbsp;be fun, and there's sure to be something to learn for everyone.  So, if you're in the area, c'mon out and support your local Refresh! Or at least come out for the drinks afterwards...</p>

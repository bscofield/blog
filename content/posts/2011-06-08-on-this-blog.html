<p>Oh! I should mention -- this is the fourth, fifth, or twenty-third incarnation of my blog, all told. It's running on Posterous, which provides an import feature that I used to bring over all of my old posts. Unfortunately, the import isn't perfect, meaning that a lot of old posts have lost some or most of their formatting, and in many cases links don't work. Sorry! I'm hopeful that future value will make up for past pain, but you all will be the judge of that....</p>

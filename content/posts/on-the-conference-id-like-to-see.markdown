I'm in Sweden at the moment, taking part in an amazing [Nordic Ruby](http://www.nordicruby.org/) conference. Yesterday, I gave a talk called [*Better: A Field Guide to Continuous Improvement*](https://speakerdeck.com/bscofield/better-a-field-guide-to-continuous-improvement), which was about topics that have been much on my mind over the past few years. Several of the other talks here have dealt -- directly or indirectly -- with the same topics, and being here has just reinforced how much I'd love to see a specific sort of conference.

In my head, I'm calling this conference BETTER. It would be devoted to the idea of *improvement*, of getting better, but not solely for professional expertise. The talks would each fall into specific slots on two metrics. First, they'd be divided up by domain:

   * improving professionally (skills),
   * improving socially (moral and ethical), and
   * improving personally (health, mood, welfare)

Then, for each domain, there would be three sorts of talks:

   * research,
   * technology, and
   * practice

Altogether, that makes for nine slots -- and as examples for the sort of talks I'd most love to see across those:

   * professional / research: [K. Anders Ericsson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Anders_Ericsson)
   * professional / practice: [Atul Gawande](http://gawande.com/)
   * social / research: [Dan Ariely](http://danariely.com/)
   * social / technology: [Lauren McCarthy](http://lauren-mccarthy.com/)
   * personal / technology: [Eric Friedman](http://www.fitbit.com/company)
   * personal / practice: [Buster Benson](http://busterbenson.com/)

So, who's in? Should I kickstart this ala [XOXO](http://2012.xoxofest.com/conference/)? (Or: I wouldn't be upset if someone took this idea and ran with it.)

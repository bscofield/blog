title: On Levels of Description
published: true

<p class="p1">I've been fascinated by levels of description for as long as I can remember:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">physics, chemistry, and biology as a kid -- with both expected and emergent properties at each level</li>
<li class="li1">neurology to consciousness as an undergrad</li>
<li class="li1">different levels of selection in (and beyond) evolutionary theory in grad school</li>
<li class="li1">abstraction and realism in comics during my brief tenure as a web designer</li>
<li class="li1">low- to high-fidelity with user interface design (wireframes, mockups, etc.)</li>
<li class="li1">methods, classes, libraries, applications, and ecosystems, and how similar design patterns can be applied at each over the past couple of years</li>
<li class="li1">requirements, implementation plans, and code in my daily work</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">I think the impact of choosing the right level to discuss a particular problem can't be overstated -- to paraphrase Einstein: discuss things as generally as possible, but no more generally. Check out any work on wireframing or paper prototyping and you'll hear exactly why this is important: discussion tends to happen at the finest-level of grain you provide.</p>
<p class="p1">If you give someone a wireframe with actual user interface elements, they'll argue over whether checkboxes or radio buttons are appropriate -- not whether there's more or less information on the page than there should be. If you give someone a mockup in color, they'll debate over the shade of blue you used -- not over whether the elements of the page are in the correct relationship to each other. If you present a new project by showing code, they'll argue over database schemas and method names instead of whether you've actually solved the problem at hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">So: be aware and intentional about how you communicate, and make sure you're talking about things at the right level.</p>

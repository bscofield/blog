title: Failure is bad.
published: true

<p>I just read&nbsp;<a href="http://learntoduck.com/startups/too-much-failure">a post from Micah Baldwin</a> that I found very interesting, so here's a quick response:  Failure is bad.  Success is good.  Sure, failure can teach you valuable lessons - but so can success, and success has the added benefit of&nbsp;<em>being success</em>.  What the "failure is good" mentality misses is that failure is good&nbsp;<em>only as a means to future success</em>. Micah's friend did exactly the right thing: he used his past failures to guide him to the choice that he perceives has a greater potential for success. In my book, that merits much more than a, "Fair enough." Anything else would be actively courting failure &ndash; mistaking the process for the goal, and forgetting the&nbsp;<a href="http://benscofield.com/2009/10/follow-through/">lessons of follow-through</a>.</p>

<p>[[posterous-content:vidmnkAIvtEHqHcylwcn]]In case you didn't notice, the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2010/public/cfp/84">CFP</a> for&nbsp;<a href="http://railsconf.com/">RailsConf 2010</a> in Baltimore went out yesterday &ndash; and along with it, the news that I'm co-chairing the conference with&nbsp;<a href="http://chadfowler.com/">Chad Fowler</a>. I'm very excited to be a part of the team this year, and I'm really looking forward to helping shape the conference.  If you've got ideas for how RailsConf could be the very best it can be, I'm all ears! Feel free to leave a comment here, or&nbsp;<a href="mailto:railsconf@turrean.com">email me</a>.</p>

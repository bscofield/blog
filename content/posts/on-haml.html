<p>I've been very happy to see that, for the most part, the evangelism around <a href="http://haml-lang.com/">Haml</a> has died down over the past year or so -- it felt like you couldn't go anywhere in 2010 without getting slapped in the face with significant whitespace. It still crops up every once in a while, though, so I thought I'd add my ever-welcome $0.02 and explain why I don't use it.</p>
<ol>
<li>HTML isn't broken. Sure, it takes more keystrokes, but there are no faults in HTML that are fixed by Haml (unlike <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>, which actually does fix problems in CSS -- and can I just cheer the separation of Sass into <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/sass">its own gem</a>?).</li>
<li>Significant horizontal whitespace becomes a gigantic problem when you have more than one screen of content. Even relatively simple web pages can run to multiple pages of markup, invalidating the "indentation as visible structure" argument.</li>
<li>Haml implicitly promotes a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>-heavy markup structure -- it's just too easy to go <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>-crazy with Haml, instead of the slimmer, more semantic markup style that I prefer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, your mileage may vary. Do what you want, but please stop accosting those of us who choose something else.</p>
<p><strong>Edited: </strong>Haml isn't an acronym, so all of my "HAML"s were incorrect. Sorry!</p>

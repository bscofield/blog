title: Developer Day Austin wrapup

<p>It's been a few days since we wrapped up&nbsp;<a href="http://developer-day.com/events/2010-austin.html">Developer Day Austin</a>, and I'm only now able to catch my breath &ndash; a few snowmageddon- and planning-related incidents combined to keep me pretty busy over the weekend and this week.  In a lot of ways, Austin reminded me of the very first&nbsp;<a href="http://developer-day.com/events/2009-durham.html">Developer Day</a>, back in March of last year. Some of the lessons in logisitics that we learned at that first event, in particular, were significantly reinforced by our experiences in Austin. Despite a few hiccups, however, the event as a whole went over well. I think we were able to bring together at least a few people who don't often meet up &ndash; front-end developers and Rubyists, with a few Pythonists and others in the mix.  Our lineup of talks was front-end heavy this go-round, and that was interesting; I thought&nbsp;<a href="http://speakerrate.com/talks/2062-javascript-ui-architecture-be-all-that-you-can-be">Kyle Simpson</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://speakerrate.com/talks/2064-superclassy-inheritance-with-javascript">Alex Sexton</a> did a great job bringing the JavaScript thunder, for instance, and I'm encouraged to bring in more front-end talks at future events (especially because JavaScript is almost a&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca"><em>lingua franca</em></a> for web developers at this point).&nbsp;Unfortunately, I had to leave midway through the day (the aforementioned snowmageddon incident), so I missed&nbsp;<a href="http://speakerrate.com/talks/2065-the-art-of-the-spike">Aaron Bedra</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://speakerrate.com/talks/2066-why-jmatter-matters">Eitan Suez</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://speakerrate.com/talks/2067-mary-poppins-meets-the-matrix">Bruce Tate</a>, each of whom I was excited to see.  And a few words about Austin... first, Austin is clearly&nbsp;<a href="http://gowalla.com/">Gowalla</a> territory. Stepping off the plane, I was struck by how many featured spots there were, and it made bopping from place to place a lot of fun. Second, it was much colder than I expected. If I thought I underdressed for&nbsp;<a href="http://developer-day.com/events/2009-boulder.html">Boulder</a> last year, it was nothing compared to the mismatch of expectations that Austin (and Dallas, on the way back) triggered.  Anyways, I think Austin provided a good start for the 2010 Developer Day season, and I'm really looking forward to the rest of the series &ndash; speaking of which, the next event is February 27th in Durham, NC, so if you're anywhere nearby&nbsp;<a href="http://developer-day.com/events/2010-durham.html">register today</a>!</p>

I had a lot of fun doing my [post about my reading for the past year](https://medium.com/@bscofield/my-2017-in-reading-1f2163dc997a) , so I figured I’d take a shot at doing something similar for my podcast listening. The data’s a little bit trickier to figure out for podcast hosts than it is for authors, but here’s a shot at it.

### The numbers

I listened to around **1680 hours** of content in 2017, spread across **1890 episodes** of **107 distinct shows**. I listen to most shows at 1.5x to 1.7x speed, so my actual time spent listening was closer to **1,050 hours** — that’s still more than a month of solid listening, though, of which the vast majority was done while I was driving, walking the dog, jogging, rowing, cleaning, or otherwise doing something that left my ears free.

### Demographics

For podcast demographics, I’m looking at regular hosts — not guests or fill-in hosts. I’m reasonably sure of my categorization for most of the podcasts I listened to regularly. I’m also going to give the breakdown as a percentage of shows AND as a percentage of content I heard.

About 15% of the shows I listened to (making up 14.3% of the content I heard) were hosted by people of color. A full third of the shows (but only 11% of the content) were hosted by people identifying as female or non-binary. 15% of the shows (23% of the content) had LGBT+ hosts. In total, 45% of the shows I listened to, and 52% of the content (870+ hours) had hosts from underrepresented groups. I’d like to do a bit better on all of these metrics — especially that % of time spent listening to non-male voices — in 2018.

### Genres

The podcasts I listened to ranged over a wide set of genres, but there were some clear trends. More than 14% of the shows I listened to were related to role-playing games (actual plays, reviews, etc.). Politics shows made up another 9.5%, followed by technology / startup stuff at 8.6%. Shows about psychology were 7.6% of my subscription list, and philosophy came in at 5.7%. After that, shows about art, economics, law, television, humor, and more all came in under 5% each.

### Favorites

I loved … too many shows this past year (see that top line listened number for proof). I’m going to limit this list to just a few, though.

*   The [Campaign podcast](//oneshotpodcast.com/category/podcasts/campaign/) is now and will forever hold the top spot on my list of favorite podcasts. It’s an actual play RPG set in the Star Wars universe (prior to A New Hope), following a crew of lovable, often-incompetent, and deeply realized misfits who are raising a Force-sensitive child while trying to get top-secret plans for something they call the Murderball to the nascent Rebellion.
*   [Pod Save America](https://crooked.com/podcast-series/pod-save-america/) is my go-to when I’m feeling overwhelmed by the state of the country. It’s got the absolute best ad reads, along with great interviews and insights from a group of former Obama staffers.
*   I ran across Buffy the Vampire Slayer when I was in college, and I watched it loyally for years to follow. I don’t know if I got as much enjoyment out of it then as I do now when listening to [Buffering the Vampire Slayer](https://www.bufferingthevampireslayer.com/), though, which gives me a whole new perspective on a show that I’m really attached to.
*   [Very Bad Wizards](https://verybadwizards.fireside.fm/) is a collaboration between a philosopher and a psychologist; they talk about everything from moral philosophy, to the current state of research on general intelligence in psychology, to the rationality of using a Star Trek-style transporter, and I love it.
*   I used to do CrossFit, and while there’s a lot of faddishness in the community, there are also some really smart people thinking about ways to get better at a wide variety of skills. The conversations with Ben Bergeron on the [Chasing Excellence](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/chasing-excellence-ben-bergeron/id1170629044?mt=2) podcast are applicable far beyond the gym, and it jumps to the top of my podcast app when a new episode shows up.

### Looking forward

I think I listened to too much content in 2017, so I’m going to try to be a bit more selective next year. At the same time, I’d like to broaden the range of voices I hear, as I mentioned up in the demographics section. Podcast discovery is a trash fire, though, so I’d more than welcome any recommendations people might have!

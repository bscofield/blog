title: A blast from the past, for technical speakers
published: true
---
<p>I've been doing a lot of reading about technical presentations lately - both for my own benefit (since I'm speaking much more often now) and for a specific project I'm working on. In the course of that research, I ran across one essay in particular that I wish was more well known.</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Let there be an end to incredibly boring speakers! They are not sophisticated, erudite scientists speaking above our intellectual capacity; they are arrogant, thoughtless individuals who insult our very presence by their lack of concern for our desire to benefit from a meeting which we chose to attend.</blockquote>
<p>So begins Jay H. Lehr's "Let There Be Stoning!" It was originally published in a research journal in 1985, but it remains an accurate indictment of technical speakers in every discipline I've worked in (including academia as well as software development). It's a quick read, so if you have even the hint that you might be speaking at a technical event in the future, you'd be well-served to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.geol.wwu.edu/rjmitch/stoning.pdf">read the PDF</a> and spend some real time thinking about its message. Your audience will thank you!  (I first discovered this essay through&nbsp;<a href="http://presentationzen.com">Presentation Zen</a>, which should also be required reading of any and every speaker.)</p>

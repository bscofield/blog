<p>I've been blogging on and off for ... heck, years now, and I've tried a lot of different approaches during that time. Among other things, I've had a fitness/running specific blog (which connected me to a wonderful, supportive community), I've had several work-specific blogs, I've tried microblogs of varying stripes - like I said, lots of different approaches.  That said, I'm now trying another. For most of my professional life, my online presence has been centered around the domain <a href="http://www.culann.com">culann.com</a>. Given my current career direction, however, I'm resetting all of that - so going forward, culann will turn into more of a personal, microblogging site (and in fact, I'm probably going to move it over to <a href="http://tumblr.com">tumblr</a>), and my work life will revolve around this, benscofield.com. Hopefully it won't be too confusing to longtime (or new!) readers.</p>

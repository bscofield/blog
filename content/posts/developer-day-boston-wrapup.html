title: Developer Day Boston wrapup
published: true
---
<p>This past weekend was exciting, because it was the first instance of <a href="http://developer-day.com">Developer Day</a> held away from <a href="http://www.viget.com">Viget</a>'s and <a href="http://thinkrelevance.com">Relevance</a>'s home territory - we took the show on the road up to Boston, with a lot of help from <a href="http://thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot</a> and the <a href="http://microsoftcambridge.com">Microsoft NERD Center</a> (which, incidentally, is an astounding space). It was both a lot of work and a lot of fun (at least for the half I was able to see; a minor emergency forced me to leave after lunch, so I missed the excellent afternoon talks), and I'm excited to continue taking Developer Day to places where smart people are doing good work.  I've posted a <a href="http://www.viget.com/extend/regarding-recent-events/">general recap</a> over on <a href="http://www.viget.com/extend">Viget Extend</a>, with comments from some of the attendees, so I'll spend the remainder of this post recapping my talk: <em>"Comics" Is Hard: Alternative Databases</em>. I gave this talk at <a href="http://www.rubynation.org/">RubyNation</a> a few months ago, and thanks to the <a href="http://speakerrate.com/talks/1169-comics-is-hard-domain-modeling-challenges">feedback I got there</a>, I was able to shift the focus a bit more towards what people wanted to see, with some great results (based on the <a href="http://speakerrate.com/talks/1314-comics-is-hard-alternative-databases">SpeakerRate response</a>). I'm very excited to see the talk continue to evolve, as I'll be giving it again in <a href="http://windycityrails.org">Chicago</a> in a little less than a month - and beyond that, hopefully it'll inspire people to take a look (or another look) at alternatives to the traditional relational database model. There's a ton of exciting work going on with key-value stores, document-oriented databases, and more, and I think they're much more generally useful than the mainstream currently appreciates.  And with all that said, here are the slides!</p>

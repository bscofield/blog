<p>[[posterous-content:sgnwcAejwckatlhHxfhx]]Developer Day has visited <a href="http://developer-day.com/events/2009-durham.html">Durham</a>, <a href="http://developer-day.com/events/2009-dc.html">DC</a>, and <a href="http://developer-day.com/events/2009-boston.html">Boston</a> so far.... Isn't it about time we left the east coast and headed west?  <a href="http://developer-day.com/events/2009-boulder.html">Developer Day Boulder is coming on October 10th!</a> We're still in the process of finalizing details, but so far we've got <a href="http://chadfowler.com/">Chad Fowler</a> keynoting, <a href="http://www.davideisinger.com/">David Eisinger</a> speaking on using email as an interface for your application, and <a href="http://robsanheim.com/">Rob Sanheim</a> talking about building in the cloud -  and if the past is any indication, the rest of the speakers (who'll be announced over the next few weeks) will be fantastic developers and practitioners in a variety of languages, technologies, and domains.  Early bird registration lasts until September 25th, and is just $50 for a full day of great talks, food, a t-shirt, and some good old-fashioned community building. After that, the fee'll jump to $75, and the shirt won't be guaranteed, so if you're anywhere in the Boulder-Denver area and free on the 10th, register today!</p>

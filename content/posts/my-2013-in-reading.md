I've been using [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) reliably this year to track my reading (well, the book and graphic novel portions of my reading). Over the last month, I've been exploring that data -- mostly for my own personal enjoyment, but also to see if there were any useful, gleanable insights into how I read. We're not quite out of 2013 yet, but I thought it might be interesting to record what I've found so far in one place. Warning: this is navel-gazing of an extreme form.

## The reading challenge

Goodreads allows readers to create a reading challenge every year -- a public commitment to read a certain number of books. In 2012, I read just over 100 books, so I thought I'd push myself in 2013 and committed to an average of 3 per week, for a total of 156.

I finished the challenge on December 14th; I was on pace for much of the first half of the year, but gradually fell behind until a prolific stretch in November and December.

All in all, I think I overdid it -- I'm a fan of committing to reading, but my choice to go big ended up siphoning off some of the joy I get from reading. I pressured myself to power through some books when I'd have preferred to take a bit more time.

## When I read

I mentioned falling behind pace at one point. As it turns out, that slowdown started when I [left LivingSocial](//benscofield.com/on-taking-time-to-think/) in early April. Weirdly, I stopped reading (or at least *finishing*) when I wasn't working -- it happened again after [Wantful shut down](//johnpoisson.com/post/60467938116/some-news-about-wantful/). This chart shows the number of books finished by day, with each month getting its own row (January's on top).

## Reads-in-progress

I've always known that I have a bit of a ... problem focusing on just one book at a time. Now, I have data!

(The colors correspond to the chart in "What I read", below)

March is interesting, as I worked down my in-progress stack to 2 for the first time in as long as I can remember.

This chart is a bit misleading; it only shows books that I finished, and (at it happens) I started one in late March that I'm still chugging through. With that in mind, I maxed out at 10 books at once in early August (just after I started at Wantful).

For reference, I've currently got three books in-progress. Two of 'em are long-timers, so who knows when I'll finish them.

## "I just like liking things"

According to the data, I've enjoyed the vast majority of what I read this year. Goodreads ratings are out of 5 -- this chart shows the percentage of books (overall and of each type) that got a given rating.

## What I read

This chart shows books completed by type -- fiction, non-fiction, comics, and technical/business (top to bottom)

![Completed books by genre](https://raw.github.com/bscofield/bscofield.github.com/source/images/genres.png)

I've abandoned tech books in the last third of the year, and for whatever reason avoided comics until I left LivingSocial, but otherwise had both fiction and non-fiction in-progress through the whole year.

## How I read

93% of my reading was done digitally -- on a Kindle or iPad. Given that I have over a hundred physical books on my to-be-read shelves at home (relics from a pre-ebook era), I need to shift that in 2014.

## Closing thoughts

I think the reading data on its own is fun (for me, and maybe for you) to look at, but any real value is dependent on correlating it with other information -- things happening outside of the books. As just one example: my slowdown between jobs is interesting, especially since it happened **both** times. I've got some analyses in the work that'll hopefully let me start looking at those sorts of interactions, but it'll take awhile.

On reading, specifically: I'd love to have more granular data about things like reading speed, re-reads, and whatnot, but I don't think that's likely in the near future (ebooks make it possible to gather that data reliably, but mine is locked away inside Amazon and I don't foresee them releasing it anytime soon).

Beyond all that: I really love to read. I'm not going to commit to a huge goal in 2014, but be sure that I'll keep track of what I do read.

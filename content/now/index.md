### Expertise, understanding, and attention

I've been thinking about expertise for well over a decade now -- what does it mean to have it? How do you develop it? -- and I've been doing more (self-directed) research over the last few months. I'm not entirely convinced that a single unified theory of expertise across all domains is possible or worthwhile, but I've got some working ideas that I'm always looking to explore.

My current view is that expertise is: a set of factors, acquired through specific effort, that contribute to reliably superior perfomance in a domain. Most recently, I've been thinking of expertise as having three types of component: attention, understanding, and action. Expert performers *attend* to different things than novices, and have better control over their attention. Expert performers *understand* aspects of their domain in ways that novice's don't. Expert performers are capable (through skill, changes to their bodies, etc.) of taking *actions* that novices can't reliably replicate.

Of these components, I've been drilling down on attention and understanding -- I think attention is vastly understudied, and understanding seems to be in a potential golden period with the flurry of work in tools for thought and related fields.

### Work

As of mid-April, I've taken on the role of fractional CTO at [Watertight](https://watertight.co/), helping build out their product and engineering organization as they raise funding and work to make the relationship between content producers and brands more efficient. I've kept that fractional, however, so I can devote a significant amount of attention to a couple of projects that fall directly in line with my larger goals around expertise and knowledge -- hopefully I'll have more to say about that soon. 

### Family

We're healthy and happy (or as much so as can be expected for a tween and a high-schooler). We're looking forward to spring and summer after a dreary winter, and we're hoping that some fruit trees we planted last year will start to produce ðŸ¤ž

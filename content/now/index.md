### Thinking about expertise, understanding, and context

I'm still very interested in expertise, and I've been actively seeking out opportunities to learn from researchers doing primary work on it. I'm particularly interested in how we individuate domains of expertise; we talk about people excelling at complex sports (say, baseball), for instance, but there's no single *way* of doing so. Pitchers are (generally) experts at very different things than outfielders; catchers differ substantially from shortstops. Is there a single notion of "baseball expertise," then, or ought we look at things more granularly?

My current view of expertise is that (to oversimplify) it consists of both _skill_ and _understanding_ in a given domain. Skill feels like well-trodden territory -- it's obvious and (relatively) easy to study, but I've been disappointed with the research on understanding, especially once you get out of philosophy of science.

Right now, I'm mostly thinking about understanding and *context*, how understanding something involves situating it in your existing context, finding connections, etc. As part of that, I'm looking to spin up an experiment on how we create and consume certain types of knowledge (like history, for instance), so hopefully there'll be more about that in a future update here.

### Working at HomeLight

At the end of July, I left [GitHub](https://github.com/) to join [HomeLight](https://www.homelight.com/) as their first Principal Engineer. I'm looking forward to working with the team to build engineering practices that can scale as we grow; right now, I'm still in the midst of meeting everyone and building my mental model of our systems.Primer and its status as an open source project.

### Surviving the pandemic

The family and I have been fortunate; we've been riding out the pandemic at home in North Carolina. The kids finished their full year of virtual school in June, and are into the first weeks of the next school year back in person (they're on year-round schedules, so the summer break is shorter than when I was a kid -- we did have time for a short trip to the beach, though). Three of us are fully vaccinated, and we're waiting anxiously for the vaccines to be approved for the <12 set so that we can get our youngest protected.

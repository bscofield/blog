### Thinking about expertise, understanding, and context

I'm still very interested in expertise, and I've been actively seeking out opportunities to learn from researchers doing primary work on it. I'm particularly interested in exploring how we tend to lump multiple distinct expertises together.

My current view of expertise is that (to oversimplify) it consists of both _skill_ and _understanding_ in a given domain. I don't think I currently have a great model of what "understanding" _is_, though, so I'm actively reading and thinking about it.

And continuining on that theme, I'm pretty sure that context is core to understanding (in a few different ways), so I'm starting to think about that more deeply -- how can we create context to generate understanding quickly, etc.

### Working at GitHub

I'm a Staff Engineer at [GitHub](https://github.com/), working as part of the UI Platform group. Among other things, I'm looking at changes we could make to [Primer React](https://primer.style/components/) to make it more flexible as we grow, improving how we evaluate frontend engineering candidates' technical abilities, and helping new engineer hires get a solid grip on the firehose of information coming their way in the first few weeks after they join.

### Surviving the pandemic

The family and I have been riding out the pandemic at home in North Carolina; the kids are in virtual school, my spouse is fully vaccinated, and I've had my first dose ðŸ’‰. We're all a little stir crazy thanks to too much time inside the house, but we've been incredibly fortunate so far, and we're looking forward to (safely) taking some trips this summer.

### Work

It's been over a year since I left HomeLight, and it's been a good year. I've been contracting for the last six months or so, splitting my time between helping various companies and working on my own development and learning projects. I expect to continue contracting through the end of the year, but in 2024 I'm hoping to find (or create) a role where I can dig in on expertise acquisition much more deeply.

### Expertise

Speaking of, on the expertise front I'm still reading, thinking, and writing about what it *means* to be good at some domain. I've harbored ambitions of starting a podcast on the topic for a while now, talking to folks at all stages of development to see how their thoughts about their domain change over time (what does a novice pay attention to, for instance, and how does that change as they learn?). If you're interested in talking about that, for any domain, give me a shout!

### Family

We remain happy and healthy; we've been unusually busy with trips and events over the past few months (Renaissance Faire! Movie nights! Sleepovers! (US) Thanksgiving!), and we're looking forward to resting a bit more as we move into the new year -- and maybe, hopefully, seeing some snow this winter.

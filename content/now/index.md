### Thinking about expertise, understanding, and context

I'm still very interested in expertise, though my self-directed research has slowed a bit over the last few months as I settle into my new job. I'm continuing to think about the nature of expertise -- what do you have when you have it? How do you develop it? -- and trying to fit expertise across a wide variety of domains into a single model (though I've started to wonder if such a unified theory of expertise is particularly worthwhile)

My current view is that expertise is a combination of skill and understanding; these combine with (for lack of a better term) capabilities to produce reliably superior performance in a given domain.

I've been thinking about the role of technology (how it can compensate for a lack of one of those factors to improve performance), and especially about how understanding is related to context (understanding a topic involves situating it within your existing context, finding connections, etc.)

### Work

After a bit more than a year, I decided to leave [HomeLight](https://www.homelight.com/) to take some time to think about what I want to work on going into 2023. I took November and December to reset, dive into some topics that I'm finding exciting, and think through some projects I've had on the backburner for years. Now that we're into 2023, I'm going to be starting conversations with folks and companies to see where I might fit in to a new opportunity.

### Family

We've continued to stay healthy; we saw one set of grandparents at Thanksgiving and the other over Hannukah and Christmas, and both sides of the family are doing pretty well. The kids go back to school in a few days (for the high schooler) or next week (for the fifth grader), and I think we're all excited to get back to friends and routine after having had a lot of fun over the holidays.

### Expertise, understanding, and attention

I've been thinking about expertise for well over a decade now -- what does it mean to have it? How do you develop it? -- and I've been doing more (self-directed) research over the last few months. I'm not entirely convinced that a single unified theory of expertise across all domains is possible or worthwhile, but I've got some working ideas that I'm always looking to explore.

My current view is that expertise is: a set of factors, acquired through specific effort, that contribute to reliably superior perfomance in a domain. Most recently, I've been thinking of expertise as having three types of component: attention, understanding, and action. Expert performers *attend* to different things than novices, and have better control over their attention. Expert performers *understand* aspects of their domain in ways that novice's don't. Expert performers are capable (through skill, changes to their bodies, etc.) of taking *actions* that novices can't reliably replicate.

Of these components, I've been drilling down on attention and understanding -- I think attention is vastly understudied, and understanding seems to be in a potential golden period with the flurry of work in tools for thought and related fields.

### Work

Towards the end of last year, I decided to leave [HomeLight](https://www.homelight.com/) to take some time to think about what I want to work on going into 2023. I took November and December to reset, dive into some topics that I'm finding exciting, and think through some projects I've had on the backburner for years. I'm currently having conversations with folks and companies to see what might be my best path forward, where hopefully I'll be able to do work towards my long-term interests in expertise and related fields. If I could wave a magic wand and create my ideal role it'd probably something like research and applied research, but I'm encouraged by many of the folks I've met so far.

### Family

We're healthy and happy (or as much so as can be expected for a tween and a high-schooler). We're looking forward to the warmer weather coming and have enjoyed the previews we've gotten so far, and we've done an OK job of keeping up some of the family activities we took up during the height of the pandemic (family movie and game nights). Now our struggle is mostly to identify movies that we parents loved in 80s that hold up well enough for the kids to enjoy them ðŸ˜…

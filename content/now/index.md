### Working at GitHub

I'm a Staff Engineer at GitHub, working as part of the UI Platform group. My attention is currently split across several areas. Here are a few of them:

* What changes do we need to make to [Primer React](https://primer.style/components/) better meet our future needs?
* How we evaluate frontend engineering candidates' skill and knowledge?
* How can we onboard new engineers so that they feel comfortable more quickly?

### Thinking about expertise

I'm still very interested in expertise, and I've been actively seeking out opportunities to learn from researchers doing primary work on it. I'm particularly interested in exploring how we tend to lump multiple distinct expertises together.

### Thinking about understanding

My current view of expertise is that (to oversimplify) it consists of both _skill_ and _understanding_ in a given domain. I don't think I currently have a great model of what "understanding" _is_, though, so I'm actively reading and thinking about it.

### Thinking about context

And continuining on that theme, I'm pretty sure that context is core to understanding (in a few different ways), so I'm starting to think about that more deeply -- how can we create context to generate understanding quickly, etc.

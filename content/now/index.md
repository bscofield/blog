### Thinking about expertise, understanding, and context

I'm still very interested in expertise, and I've been actively seeking out opportunities to learn from researchers doing primary work on it. I'm particularly interested in exploring how we tend to lump multiple distinct expertises together.

My current view of expertise is that (to oversimplify) it consists of both _skill_ and _understanding_ in a given domain. I don't think I currently have a great model of what "understanding" _is_, though, so I'm actively reading and thinking about it.

And continuining on that theme, I'm pretty sure that context is core to understanding (in a few different ways), so I'm starting to think about that more deeply -- how can we create context to generate understanding quickly, etc.

### Working at GitHub

I'm a Staff Engineer at [GitHub](https://github.com/), working as part of the UI Platform group. I've spent a while now focused on how we interview and assess front-end engineering candidates, and as of very recently I'm taking on a greater role in the [React](https://primer.style/components/) part of our Primer design system. 

### Surviving the pandemic

The family and I have been riding out the pandemic at home in North Carolina; the kids are in virtual school, my spouse is fully vaccinated, and I've had my first dose ðŸ’‰. We're all a little stir crazy thanks to too much time inside the house, but we've been incredibly fortunate so far, and we're planning our first trips to visit also-vaccinated family members in the next few months.

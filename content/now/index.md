### Questions

There are a few questions I'm particularly invested in right now:

- What lessons can be generalized from skill acquisition / motor learning research to non-motor expertise?
- Closely related: how general can a theory of expertise even *be*?
- What blocks exist to taking knowledge and skills from experts and teaching them directly to novices? (For instance: maybe experts do X, but you can only do X successfully if you already know Y, so you can't *just* teach novices X)
- What's the lowest-friction stack for building extremely personal applications and tools?

## Work

I've been contracting / freelancing for about a year now; I've spent most of that time working with a company at the intersection of web3 and AI, helping them build out their offerings. At the same time, I've also been thinking a lot about those questions above, and I'd love to find a role where I could focus on them full-time.

## Expertise

Obviously, this is my primary interest right now (even the low-friction stack is related; I want it to be as easy and quick as possible to build tools and experiments to test out means of accelerating the development of expertise and understanding). I've started recording interviews for a podcast that I've wanted to exist for ages, and I'm hoping to start publishing it soon.

### Family

We remain happy and healthy; we're in the height of our birthday season (all four of us have birthdays over the course of 3.5 months), so it's a fun time. Spring break just ended and both kids are in the home stretch of the school year, and we're planning summer trips now.

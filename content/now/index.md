### Thinking about expertise, understanding, and context

I'm still very interested in expertise, though my self-directed research has slowed a bit over the last few months as I settle into my new job. I'm continuing to think about the nature of expertise -- what do you have when you have it? How do you develop it? -- and trying to fit expertise across a wide variety of domains into a single model (though I've started to wonder if such a unified theory of expertise is particularly worthwhile)

My current view is that expertise is a combination of skill, understanding, and (though I don't have a better term yet) capability, all of which combine to produce reliably superior performance in a given domain.

I've been thinking about the role of technology (how it can compensate for a lack of one of those factors to improve performance), and especially about how understanding is related to context (understanding a topic involves situating it within your existing context, finding connections, etc.)

### Working at HomeLight

At the end of July, I left [GitHub](https://github.com/) to join [HomeLight](https://www.homelight.com/) as their first Principal Engineer. Since then, I've been working with the team to build engineering practices that can scale as we grow. Some of that work is head-down in the code or in infrastructure, but for the most part I'm having great conversations with people every day.

### Surviving the pandemic

Our family has been extremely fortunate. Aside from two short trips (both taken in the last four months), we've been mostly house-bound here in North Carolina. The kids have been back in school since July and are doing well -- especially since our youngest got her first shot earlier this month. Our families are fully vaccinated, and we're looking foward to spending a bit of time with them in the coming months.

### Thinking about expertise, understanding, and context

I'm still very interested in expertise, and I've been actively seeking out opportunities to learn from researchers doing primary work on it. I'm particularly interested in exploring how we tend to lump multiple distinct expertises together.

My current view of expertise is that (to oversimplify) it consists of both _skill_ and _understanding_ in a given domain. Skill feels like well-trodden territory -- it's obvious and (relatively) easy to study, but I've been disappointed with the research on understanding, especially once you get out of philosophy of science.

Right now, I'm mostly thinking about understanding and *context*, how understanding something involves situating it in your existing context, finding connections, etc. As part of that, I'm looking to spin up an experiment on how we create and consume certain types of knowledge (like history, for instance), so hopefully there'll be more about that in a future update here.

### Working at GitHub

I'm a Staff Engineer at [GitHub](https://github.com/), working as part of the UI Platform group. I'm currently the product lead for [Primer React](https://primer.style/components/), the React implementation of GitHub's [Primer](https://primer.style/) design system; one of my main concerns at the moment is figuring out the correct balance between our internal usage of Primer and its status as an open source project.

### Surviving the pandemic

The family and I have been riding out the pandemic at home in North Carolina; the kids' year of virtual school is wrapping up soon, and we'll be glad to see the back of it. My spouse and I are both fully vaccinated, and my oldest daughter had her first shot a few days ago. We're *really* looking forward to being able to travel again, and our first trip to visit already-vaccinated grandparents is coming up at the end of the month.
